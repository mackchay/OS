1) nm hello :
	unresolved symbol means you've detected smth that is not defined
	here i've detected puts as U (compilor changed printf to puts)

2) ldd hello

3) the process of creating static library:
	- created C file with function definition and then Header file with function declearation
	- compiled library files without linking them
	- [ar - creates archives] -> to bundle multiple object files in one static lib
	   ar rcs hello_static.a hello_static

4) to use this lib we need to compile it together (the lib code just puts in before) : 
	gcc hello.c lib.c (will search only in this dir)
	or
	gcc hello.c -l:lib.c (will search in "library path")

5) run the programm -> wow it works!!

6) the process of creating the dynamic library (linking staticly) :
	- compiled the lib :
	  gcc hello_dynamic.c -shared -fPIC -o hello_dynamic.so
	  [-fPIC] means "Position Independent Code" 
	  the code in this file is valid whereever its virtual address is. It is needed for shared libs
	- got all together :
	  gcc -Wl,-rpath=. hello.c hello_static.a hello_dynamic.so	

7) tun the program -> wow it works!!

8) the process of creating the dynamic library (linking dynamicly):
	- created C file and Header
	- include <dlfcn.h> in hello.c
	- write hDll and so on..
	- compiled and linked all :
	 gcc ... -Wl,-rpath=.
